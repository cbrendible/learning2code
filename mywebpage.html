        <p>
            Hi, my name is Cym. I am a video gamer, an avid reader of all genres,
            and an amateur guitarist. I live in Alaska where the summers are short
            and the winters are long. I have many brothers and sisters but only 1
            biological sister and 1 biological brother.

            I'm a self taught artist. My main medium is pencil or Autodesk Pro.
            I draw original works and fanart of anime characters. My strongest
            area is protraiture.
